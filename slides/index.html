      - FET proposed and patented in 1925, but no working device

      --

      - 17 years later the patent ran out and people started working on a working device

      --

      - 1959 working MOSFET invented at Bell Labs

      - Kickstarted the information age revolution!

      # Dinner with Cryptographers]

      ---

      ## The Dining Cryptographers Problem pt1

      --

      ‚ÄúThree cryptographers gather around a table for dinner.

      --

      The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the National Security Agency (NSA).

      --

      The cryptographers respect each other's right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid.

      ---

      ## The Dining Cryptographers Problem pt2

      ‚ÄúSo they decide to execute a two-stage protocol.

      --

      In the first stage, every two cryptographers establish a shared one-bit secret, say by tossing a coin behind a menu so that only two cryptographers see the outcome in turn for each two cryptographers.

      --

      Suppose, for example, that after the coin tossing, cryptographer A and B share a secret bit 1, A and C share 0, and B and C share 1.

      ---

      ## The Dining Cryptographers Problem pt3
      ‚ÄúIn the second stage, each cryptographer publicly announces a bit, which is:

      - if they didn't pay for the meal, the exclusive OR (XOR) of the two shared bits they hold with their two neighbours,
      - if they did pay for the meal, the opposite of that XOR.

      ---

      ## The Dining Cryptographers Problem pt4

      ‚ÄúSupposing none of the cryptographers paid, then A announces 1 ‚äï 0 = 1, B announces 1 ‚äï 1 = 0, and C announces 0 ‚äï 1 = 1.

      --

      On the other hand, if A paid, she announces ¬¨ ( 1 ‚äï 0 ) = 0.

      --

      The three public announcements combined reveal the answer to their question. One simply computes the XOR of the three bits announced.

      --

      If the result is 0, it implies that none of the cryptographers paid (so the NSA must have paid the bill).

      --

      Otherwise, one of the cryptographers paid, but their identity remains unknown to the other cryptographers.‚Äù

      # DC-networks

      --

      - Anonymous communication networks with unconditional sender and recipient untraceability

      --

      - Though simple and elegant, there are limitations

        - Collisions, eg when 2 cryptographers paid

        - Disruption, eg malicious messages

        - Complexity, eg pairwise shared secrets

      ---

      # DC-networks

      There is further research and prototypes available!
