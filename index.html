      # A Tale of Semiconductors

      ---

      Semiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivty values fall between
      **conductors** and **insulators**.

      --

      We can alter the conductivity through **doping** (aka injecting another substance to boost performance).

      Everybody's favorite semiconductor:

      Everybody's favorite semiconductor: Silicon!!

      ---

      Silicon has 4 electrons it's outer (Valence) shell (maximum of 8)

      With other silicon it will form a stable tetrahedron

      Doped with Phosphorus (5 valence electrons), will introduce an extra electron (resulting in negative charge)

      Doped with Boron (3 valence electrons), will introduce a gap (resulting in positive charge)

      ---

      What can we do with that?

      --

      ## Build a MOS transistor!

      ---

      # MOSFET

      Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor

      ---

      The theory!

      ---

      Put on voltage!

      ---

      ## And what?

      ---

      Information age revolution!

      # A little story of MOSFET

      --

      - FET proposed and patented in 1925, but no working device

      - several attempts to build a working semiconductor device after 17 year patent ran out

      - 1959 working MOSFET invented at Bell Labs

      - soon replaced vacuum tubes in computers

        - needed less energy

        - didn't burn out

        - a lot smaller

      ---

      ## Vacuum tubes

      ---

      ## Transistors today

      About 2 billion in your phone, and they're still getting smaller

      - 2013: depletion layer 22 nanometers wide (~ 50 atoms wide)

      - 2019: depletion layer 7 nanometer wide

      Between 1960 and 2018 about 13 sextillion MOSFET were made, the most manufactured device in history

      ---

      ## Moore's Law

      > The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years

      Moore's (1st) Law will come to an end, as with current transistor technology, we've reached the limit.

      --

      Moore's 2nd Law

      > the cost of a semiconductor chip fabrication plant doubles every four years

      ---

      Transistors are the fundamental part
